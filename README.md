# RestJpaTogether
this is a simple project, To practice on MVC . 
in this project there is one class which is our model in the model package
then there is an interface DataManager which could have many different implementations
like taking data from the memory or from the database via jpa
then there is the service class which makes calls to the datamanger 
finally we have the controllers which use REST api to make services and make em availble for the clients
i use POSTMAN to send https requests like get,delete,put,post
